    <h1>Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

    <div>
      <h1>Challenge</h1>
      <p>The main challenge is to <b>describe relatively complex tasks</b> by steps in an easy to understand language. These tasks
        include daily life and computers. We are more inclined to use video to learn a new skill, and the text
        tutorial maybe strange to us. However, we decided to put it in words as perfect as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>We have a problem with the steps, because we don't know <b>what materials and tools the person reading this
        instruction has</b>. So we offer as many material choices as possible.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we also don't know <b>how to use correct words</b> to express our imaginary actions properly. So we wrote the steps
         as detailed as possible, and some of the steps were split into two parts. We've also changed a lot of
         words so that we can find the words closest to our meaning.</p>

    <h2>Task 1: Pseudocode an Everyday Task</h2>
    <h3>A list of high-level tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Unclog a clogged toilet</li>
      <li>Mending the clothes</li>
      <li>Ordering a service on the phone</li>
      <li>Preparing materials for making an hotpot</li>
      <li>Make pizza</li>
      <li>Assemble a IKEA table </li>
      <li>Make Sushi</li>
      <li>Replace a Bulb</li>
      <li>Make Wonton</li>
      <li>Sort garbage</li>
      <li>Make coffee</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Break complicated tasks down into sub-steps</h3>
    <p>Make Sushi:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Steam some rice.</li>
      <li>Put some rice vinegar into the steamed rice.</li>
      <li>Cut the filling ingredients (Choose from the following: cucumber, carrot, ham, salmon, etc) into sticks.</li>
      <li>Put one piece of seaweed on a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>Put the rice with rice vinegar on the seaweed evenly</li>
      <li>Flatten the rice with a spoon.</li>
      <li>Put ingredient sticks on one side of the rice.</li>
      <li>Add mayonnaise or other condiments you like.</li>
      <img src="img/sushi.jpg" >
      <li>Roll mat from that side.</li>
      <li>Squeeze this roll.</li>
      <li>Divide mat and sushi.</li>
      <li>Cut the sushi roll into small pieces with a knife.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Task 2: Pseudocode a Computer Task</h2>
    <h3>A list of high-level computer tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jigsaw Puzzle</li>
      <li>Guess a Number Game</li>
      <li>Math Calculator</li>
      <li>Age Calculator</li>
      <li>Analog Clock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Break complicated tasks down into sub-steps</h3>
    <p>Guess a Number Game:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
      <li>Accept user input.</li>
      <li>Judge whether the number entered by the user is equal to the random number.
        If they are equal, the user wins the game. Else tell the user that the imputed
         number is smaller or bigger than the random number.</li>
      <li>Repeat 2-3 until the user win. ( You can also set a limit on the number of
        guess times).</li>
    </ol>


      <h2>Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments</h2>
      <h3>Our comments in JavaScript</h3>
      <pre><code>
// Create a random number between 1 and 100
// Loop until the user win or exceed the limit times of guess
  //Input user's guess
  //If user's guess equal to the random number
    //Print user is win and exit the Loop
  //Elseif user's guess is bigger than the random number
    //Print user's guess is bigger than the random number
  //Else print user's guess is smaller than the random number
  //Increase times of guess plus by 1</code>
