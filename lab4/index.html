    <h2>Task 2: Pseudocode a Computer Task</h2>
    <h3>A list of high-level computer tasks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jigsaw Puzzle</li>
      <li>Guess a Number Game</li>
      <li>Math Calculator</li>
      <li>Age Calculator</li>
      <li>Analog Clock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Break complicated tasks down into sub-steps</h3>
    <p>Guess a Number Game:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
      <li>Accept user input.</li>
      <li>Judge whether the number entered by the user is equal to the random number.
        If they are equal, the user wins the game. Else tell the user that the imputed
         number is smaller or bigger than the random number.</li>
      <li>Repeat 2-3 until the user win. ( You can also set a limit on the number of
        guess times).</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

      <h2>Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into Comments</h2>
      <h3>Our comments in JavaScript</h3>
      <pre>
// Create a random number between 1 and 100
// Loop until the user win or exceed the limit times of guess
  //Input user's guess
  //If user's guess equal to the random number
    //Print user is win and exit the Loop
  //Elseif user's guess is bigger than the random number
    //Print user's guess is bigger than the random number
  //Else print user's guess is smaller than the random number
  //Increase times of guess plus by 1
